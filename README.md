# cpp-maze
#### Random maze generator made with C++ and OpenCV.

30x30 maze with entrance at (0.0) and exit at (30.30). 
Algorithm guarantees that entrance and exit connect. 

Maze cannot be unsolvable. 

Maze is generated randomly so path is always different (practically). 

Has a wait timer so algorithm actions can be seen while progressing.
